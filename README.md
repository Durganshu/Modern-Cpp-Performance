# Performance aspects of Modern C++

C++ is a very powerful language usually preferred over other languages because of its incredible performance. However, its vast range of features should be used in a suitable way in order to achieve the intended performance. In this repository, I have done a comprehensive evaluation of the performance aspects of Modern C++ (C++11 and later), particularly focusing on the programming practices. 

The following elements of C++ have been investigated:

1. `std::vector`

2. `std::string` and `std::string_view`

3. Smart pointers

4. Execution policies

To evaluate the performance of these features, comprehensive benchmarks were conducted using [Quick-bench.com](https://quick-bench.com/), a platform built on [Google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark).

For execution policies, tests should be run on the local machine with `Google Benchmark` locally installed. Please follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/google/benchmark) for installing `Google-benchmark`.
